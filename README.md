## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- I created this project for my dad’s 50th birthday.
- I hade made hand-crafted 3D pop-up cards. This time I wanted to try making a digital version instead.
- In the future, I can simply send them this online card as a web link to celebrate someone’s birthday.

## 🧩 Features
- 🎈 **Floating Balloons** – Balloons smoothly rise with subtle movement variations.
- 🎉 **Falling Confetti** – A lively particle system that scatters colorful confetti across the screen.
- 🚩 **Dynamic Bunting Flags** – Color-changing flags with a wavy rope animation at the top.
- 🎁 **Dropping Gift Boxes** – Randomly falling gifts with bouncing animation and rare golden gift variations.
- 💥 **Fireworks** – Burst-style particle explosions with randomized colors and fading trails.
- 🌏 **Bilingual Message Switching** – Switches title language with scrambling transition effect.
