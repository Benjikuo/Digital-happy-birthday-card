## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- I created this project for my dad’s 50th birthday.
- Normally, I make hand-crafted 3D pop-up birthday cards, but this time I wanted to try making a digital version instead.
- In the future, whenever I want to celebrate someone’s birthday, I can simply send them this online card as a web link.

## 🧩 Features
- 🎈 Floating Balloons – Balloons smoothly rise with subtle movement variations.
- 🎉 Falling Confetti – A lively particle system that scatters colorful confetti across the screen.
- 🚩 Dynamic Bunting Flags – Color-changing flags with a wavy rope animation at the top.
- 🎁 Dropping Gift Boxes – Randomly falling gifts with bouncing animation and rare golden gift variations.
- 💥 Fireworks – Burst-style particle explosions with randomized colors and fading trails.
- 🌏 Bilingual Message Switching – Switches title language with scrambling transition effect.
